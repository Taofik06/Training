# Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
## Introduction
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!” Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched! Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers
## Problem statement
As the service gains traction, there's a pressing need to optimize the operations by leveraging collected data. The objective is to clean and analyze the existing database, enabling Danny to make data-driven decisions to improve delivery times, order management, and overall customer satisfaction.
